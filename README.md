## Problem Statement

This Sales Dashboard helps businesses track their overall sales performance across various categories, regions, and customer segments. It provides insights into category-wise sales for Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology, comparing the current and previous year's performance. The dashboard also highlights sales trends over time, enabling businesses to identify seasonal sales peaks or dips.

Key areas of focus include:

1- Sales Trends: The line charts show the month-wise comparison of sales for the current year (CY) and the previous year (PY). This helps the company pinpoint performance patterns and adjust strategies accordingly.

2- Customer Segments: The donut chart breaks down the orders by Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments, with Consumer and Corporate dominating the sales, indicating potential areas for market penetration.

3- Regional Sales: The bar chart provides insights into sales across different regions (Central, East, South, and West), comparing 2021 and 2022, showing that the East and West regions consistently outperform the other areas.
Category Ranking: The table ranks customers by their sales order history, providing valuable insights into top buyers and repeat customers.
Given that Technology is leading in total sales (272K), followed by Office Supplies and Furniture, businesses must focus on leveraging this insight to strengthen offerings in these categories. Also, considering the stable growth in certain regions, businesses should identify and address factors contributing to lower sales in regions like the South.

By using this dashboard, companies can make data-driven decisions to enhance their sales strategies, focus on high-performing segments, and optimize customer relationships.
